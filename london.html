		<h2>About this class</h2>
		<p>In 2008, the School of Journalism introduced a semester-long course on the life and times of Ernie Pyle. At the begining of the semester, students study the life and writings of Ernie Pyle, and during Spring Break the class travels to Europe to follow in the footsteps of the famous correspondent.</p>

<p>The week in Europe includes travel to London, Normandy and Paris. Students visit sites such as the Imperial War Museum, the H.M.S. Belfast, the Cabinet War Rooms, historic Omaha and Utah beaches, and Mont-Saint-Michel Cathedral.</p>

<p>The class is a journalism research elective and is open to juniors, seniors and graduate students only.</p>

	<h3 class="city">London</h3>
	<p>The first stop on the week-long trip is London, where students visits several sites that were key areas in London War II - and where Erne Pyle once held growing influence as the war gathered pace in 1940.</p>

			<h3>The Blitz tour</h3>
			<img src="images/footsteps/blitz.jpg" alt="An image of the Blitz tour">
			<p>When we met Andy Rashleigh at the Tube station in the shadow St. Paul’s Cathedral, we told him the things we knew about World War II. We craned our necks to see the grand dome at the cathedral. We apologized for Donald Trump. We were there for our first tour in London, a Blitz tour. It was a walking tour through areas that were turned to rubble when the Nazis bombed the city in 1940.</p>

			<h3>St, Paul's Cathedral</h3>
			<img src="images/footsteps/stpaul.jpg" alt="An image of the Blitz tour">
			<p>St. Paul’s was the tallest building in London until 1962, but that despite its size, it was the only building not destroyed in its immediate area during the Blitz of 1940. Not that the Germans didn’t try though; dents and cracks left by bomb shrapnel still dot its exterior.
The German failure was due to the unluckiness of the German Luftwaffe and the determination of the community to save their beloved cathedral.

			<h3>The Imperial War Museum</h3>
			<img src="images/footsteps/IWM.jpg" alt="An image of the Blitz tour">
			<p>The large four floor museum houses exhibits on WWI, WWII as well as modern wars like the Cold War. The open-air space houses countless relics and golden nuggets of information, but the exhibit on WWI is by far the most extensive.</p>
