<h2>Importance of Drinking Water</h2>
<p class="byline">By Zhinan Yin</p>
<p><span class="caps"></span>The global water crisis claims 3.4 million lives each year. The 3.4 million people with names, families, hopes and dreams are now confronted with this reality that we must respond. The water crisis is not someone else's crisis. It's all of ours. </p>
<p>When people gain access to have clean water , all amazing things will happened. Their jobs are created, sickness is prevented, and health got guaranteed. It is significant for all of us to understand that how important the clean water is not only for the place that lack of clean water.</p>
<p>Water is a fundamental human need for every people that each people on Earth requires at least 20 to 50 liter of clean, safe water a day for drinking and simply keeping themselves clean and healthy.</p>

<div class="facts">
<h4>There are some facts about drinking water.</h4>
<ol class="list">
<li>91 per cent of the global population now uses an improved drinking water source. </li>
<li>The drinking water target are now met five regions, but the Caucasus and Central Asia, Northern Africa, Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa still did not met the drinking water target.</li>
<li>Since 1990, there are 2.6 billion people have gained access to an improved drinking water.</li>
<li>Compared with 84 per cent of the rural population, there are 96 per cent of the global urban population uses improved drinking water source.</li>
<li>There are eight out of ten people still without improved drinking water sources live in rural areas. </li>
<li>The least developed countries did not meet target, but 42 per cent of the current population has gained access to improved drinking water sources since 1990.</li>
<li>In 2015, there still have 633 million people lack improved drinking water sources.</li>
</ol>

<h2>A Global Water Usage</h2>
<p>Globally, there are 2.6 billion people have gained access to an improved drinking water source since 1990. Over one third of the 2015 population gained access during the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) period in most regions. To maintain and extend the coverage of improved drinking water, the developing regions with low baselines and the experiencing rapid population growth have to work much harder. Although sub-Saharan Africa missed the MDG target, still over 40 per cent of its current population gained access since 1990.</p>
<p>To estimated the number of people that still use unimproved drinking water sources, there are still 633 million people worldwide still using unimproved water until 2015, which including unprotected wells and springs and surface water. There are two majority regions that use unimproved water most, which would be sub-Saharan Africa that includes nearly half of people. Moreover, one-fifth live in Southern Asia.</p>
<p>Since 1990, the using of improved water has increased in all regions. However, rates of progress have varied during the MDG period. In Eastern Asia, the coverage has increased by 27 percentage dramatically and exceed the MDG target that in China, there are over half billion people gained access alone. In addition, the gaining access in Southern Asia and South-eastern are also increased that by 19 and 20 percentage.</p>

<h2>Global Rural-urban disparities have decreased, but large gaps remain</h2>
<p>Majority of the global population that about 57 per cent live in rural areas in 1990. However, since the situation has reversed that the proportion living in urban areas is about 54 per cent in 2015.</p>
<p>To compared with about 84 per cent of the rural population, it is estimated that about 96 per cent of the urban population is now using improved drinking water sources. Moreover, there has research shows that while rural coverage has increased rapidly, urban coverage has stagnated.</p>
<p>Since 1990, the urban coverage with piped water on premises has also remained largely unchanged. But to access piped water in urban areas and rural areas has large gap between them that four out of five people living in urban areas now could use piped water on premises but there's only one put of three people living in rural areas could use piped water on premises.</p>
<p>The ones who live in rural areas that do not have access to improved drinking water sources is now estimated about 79 per cent of people who are using unimproved water and about 93 per cent of people who are using surface water in 2015.</p>
<p>Over the MDG period, there are nearly three quarters of 2.6 billion people gaining to an improved drinking water source on premises. Otherwise, there are over half of the 951 million people in rural areas gaining access to improved drinking water sources and there are over three quarters of the 1.6 billion people who living in the urban areas are using piping water.</p>
